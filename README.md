## EVOLVE – EV Charging Solutions App (UI/UX Case Study)

### Overview

EVOLVE is a mobile application designed to simplify access to electric vehicle charging solutions for multiple vehicle types, including cars, bikes, rickshaws, and trucks. The project focuses on creating a clear, readable, and scalable user interface that supports different EV use cases without overwhelming the user.

### Problem Statement

Existing EV charging applications often suffer from cluttered interfaces, poor readability, and complex navigation, especially when supporting multiple vehicle categories. This creates confusion and reduces usability for everyday users.

### Design Goals

* Provide a **simple and intuitive user experience**
* Maintain **high visibility and readability** across all screens
* Design a **scalable UI system** that works for different EV types
* Ensure consistent visual hierarchy and navigation

### Design Approach

The design was created using a wireframe-driven process, followed by structured UI design in Figma. Emphasis was placed on clean layouts, clear call-to-action placement, and minimal visual noise to improve usability.
